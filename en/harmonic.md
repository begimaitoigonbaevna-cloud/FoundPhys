# Harmonic Oscillations

## 📌 Definition
Harmonic oscillations are periodic motions in which the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium.

## 📐 Physical Model
Consider a mass \( m \) attached to a spring of stiffness \( k \).  
The restoring force is:
\[
F = -kx
\]

By Newton’s second law:
\[
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0
\]

This equation describes **simple harmonic motion**.

## 🔢 Solution
The general solution is:
\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]
where:
- \(A\) — amplitude  
- \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) — angular frequency  
- \(\phi\) — phase

The **period** is:
\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

## 🔍 Reflection
Simple harmonic motion is the foundation of waves, oscillations, and many physical systems.

# Harmonic Oscillations

Harmonic oscillations are repetitive motions around an equilibrium position, where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. These oscillations are found in many natural and technological systems.

**Key Concepts:**
- Amplitude (A) — maximum displacement from equilibrium.
- Period (T) — time for one complete oscillation.
- Frequency (f) — number of oscillations per second, f = 1/T.
- Angular frequency (ω) — ω = 2πf.
- Restoring force (F) — force bringing the system back to equilibrium, F = -kx.

**Main Formulas:**
1. T = 2π√(m/k), period of a simple harmonic oscillator.
2. ω = √(k/m), angular frequency.
3. x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), displacement over time.
4. v(t) = -Aω sin(ωt + φ), velocity.
5. a(t) = -Aω² cos(ωt + φ), acceleration.
6. F = -kx, restoring force.

**Examples in real life:**
- Pendulum clocks
- Springs and shock absorbers in vehicles
- Vibrations of guitar strings
- Oscillations of bridges, elevators, and buildings
- Molecular vibrations in solids

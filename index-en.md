# Harmonic Oscillations

## 📌 Definition
Harmonic oscillations are periodic motions in which the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and directed toward it.

---

## ⚙️ Physical Model
Consider a mass \( m \) attached to a spring with stiffness \( k \).

The restoring force is given by Hooke’s law:

$$
F = -kx
$$

According to Newton’s second law:

$$
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + kx = 0
$$

This differential equation describes **simple harmonic motion**.

---

## 🧮 Solution
The general solution of the equation is:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

where:
- \( A \) — amplitude  
- \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) — angular frequency  
- \( \phi \) — phase constant  

---

## ⏱ Period of Oscillation
The period of harmonic oscillations is:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
$$

## 🔍 Reflection
Simple harmonic motion is fundamental in physics and appears in waves, mechanical systems, electrical circuits, and quantum mechanics.
